        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            <br>

            At Abundant Science, we're on a mission to democratize health testing by making rapid testing a category.
            Making diagnosis faster, easier, and more accessible to everyone, without overdependence on traditional
            labs.

            <br>
            <br>

            We believe people deserve access to insights about their bodies without waiting weeks, navigating
            gatekeepers, or relying on systems that prioritize efficiency over experience. As demand for proactive,
            preventive care grows, we're building a new kind of diagnostic platform — one that puts individuals in
            control.
            <br>
            <br>

            Our vision is a connected ecosystem where at-home tests deliver immediate, meaningful results — feeding back
            into both personal health decisions and the broader healthcare system. We're not just accelerating testing —
            we're reshaping how it fits into people's lives.

            <br>
            <br>

            We exist to make health knowledge abundant — and to build a smarter, more human-centered healthcare future.
