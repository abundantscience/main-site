        <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 32px;">June 2025 Survey: 84% of Canadian Sniffies Users Want Rapid HIV
            PrEP Testing
        </h2>

        <p><strong> Toronto, June 20, 2025 </strong> – A cross-sectional study of Canadians using the geospatial
            dating platform
        Sniffies (762,699 impressions from May 15–June 15, 2025) reveals extraordinary demand for rapid HIV PrEP
            testing and personal drug testing supplies, with implications for Canada's 2030 HIV elimination goals and
            unaddressed populations like discreet MSM.</p>

        <h3>Key Findings (n=87, ±10.6% margin of error at 95% confidence)</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong> 72% identify as "discreet"</strong> (95% CI: 62%–81%) – Sniffies users prioritize boundaries,
                pointing to
                systematic gaps in current service delivery without an explicit outreach strategy</li>
            <li><strong>84% want PrEP rapid testing</strong> (95% CI: 75%–91%) – Far exceeding general population
                awareness rates,
                suggesting highly activated user base interest in alternative options to lab testing.</li>
            <li><strong>100% of non-discreet users want PrEP rapid testing</strong> (24/24, 95% CI: 85%–100%) — Among
                “outˮ users, PrEP
                rapid testing interest is universal, suggesting discretion may represent an access barrier</li>
            <li><strong>97% overlap between drug supply testing and PrEP rapid test interest</strong> – Of 33 users
                seeking drug testing, 32 also want PrEP rapid testing, indicating cross distribution opportunity for
                this sub-segment</li>
            <li><strong>11.6% conversion rate</strong> – High engagement from advertisement to email signup (747 clicks,
                87 unique
                respondents) demonstrates genuine market demand, not passive survey participation</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>The Discretion Paradox</h3>
        <p>Strikingly, a key finding challenges assumptions about hard-to-reach populations poorly represented in the
            corpus of research. While 100% of "non-discreet" users expressed PrEP rapid testing interest, 78% of
            "discreet" users indicated interest. This suggests privacy needs, not health awareness, may play a bigger
            part in barriers to ongoing PrEP compliance.</p>

        <p>"We're seeing users who are highly health-conscious but may be structurally excluded by current diagnostics
            delivery models," said Jay Gerbrandt, Chief Science Officer at Abundant Science and lead researcher. "When
            every single non-discreet user wants PrEP rapid tests, but only 78% of discreet users show interest,
            discretion becomes a structural barrier borne of a personal choice to further understand."</p>

        <h3>Market Sizing and Opportunity</h3>
        <p>With 5 of 7 required PrEP tests already Health Canada-approved in rapid form, regulatory barriers appear
            surmountable. The remaining tests have European approval, suggesting technical feasibility for comprehensive
            at-home panels.</p>

        <p>Conservative estimates based on study engagement rates suggest 15,000–25,000 potential users across major
            Canadian markets, representing $3–5M annual market opportunity at current PrEP testing costs.</p>

        <h3>By the Numbers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>762,699</strong> advertisement impressions across two regions</li>
            <li><strong>87</strong> unique respondents from 747 clicks (±10.6% margin
                of error)</li>
            <li><strong>84%</strong> expressed interest in PrEP rapid testing (95% CI: 75%–91%)</li>
            <li><strong>100%</strong> of non-discreet users wanted PrEP testing (24/24, 95% CI:
                85.7%–100%)
            </li>
            <li><strong>72%</strong> identified as "discreet" (95% CI: 62%–81%)</li>
            <li><strong>38%</strong> wanted drug testing supplies (95% CI: 28%–49%)</li>
            <li><strong>97%</strong> of drug test seekers also wanted PrEP rapid testing (32/33)</li>
            <li><strong>5</strong> of <strong>7</strong> tests required for PrEP monitoring already Health
                Canada-approved for rapid use</li>
            <li><strong>52%</strong> higher conversion in Prairie vs. Coastal regions (13.4% vs 8.83%)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Geographic Disparities</h3>
        <p>Prairie users showed 52% higher conversion rates (13.4% vs 8.83%) despite mixed rural-urban coverage,
            suggesting underserved regions are more responsive to novel access methods. This supports targeting rapid
            testing solutions to areas with limited traditional sexual health infrastructure. Continued research in
            different densities will provide more insight into distribution access.</p>

        <h3>Public Health Implications</h3>
        <p>Canada's HIV elimination strategy requires reaching approximately 7,000 undiagnosed individuals – 11% of
            people living with HIV. Platform-based interventions reaching discreet MSM populations could meaningfully
            contribute to the first "95" (diagnosis) of the 95-95-95 goal while supporting PrEP scale-up efforts.</p>

        <p>The 97% correlation between party-and-play (PnP) substance use and associated drug testing and PrEP rapid
            testing interest illuminates critical intersections between harm reduction and HIV prevention, supporting
            integrated service delivery models which could be integrated into existing deployment systems via expanded
            telehealth for both clinical and rapid testing purposes.</p>

        <h3>Study Methodology</h3>
        <p>This cross-sectional survey employed advertising-based recruitment on Sniffies from May 15–June 15, 2025,
            using sequential geographic deployment: Prairie provinces (May 15–June 8) followed by major coastal cities
            (June 9–15). Advertisements appeared across four platform placement zones, achieving 762,699 impressions and
            747 clicks.</p>

        <p>Participants completed a secure web form at abundant.science/free-hiv-rapid-test indicating interest in:
            discretion ("Your email won't say HIV in it"), PrEP rapid testing, and drug testing supplies. The study
            collected 87 unique email addresses (11.6% conversion rate) with no personal health information beyond
            self-reported interests.</p>

        <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Convenience sampling introduces selection biases limiting generalizability.
            Small sample sizes preclude robust statistical inference for subgroup comparisons. Results represent market
            signals rather than precise population conclusions.</p>

        <p><strong>Ethics:</strong> Research conducted in accordance with Canadian privacy legislation (PIPEDA, PHIPA).
            Informed consent obtained through web form submission with clear data use disclosure.</p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>Results will inform development of Canada and the worldʼs first comprehensive rapid PrEP testing panel.
            Abundant Science is exploring partnerships with private financing, provincial health authorities and harm
            reduction organizations to scale privacy-preserving testing solutions.</p>

        <p>Abundant Science is drafting a pre-print and whitepaper. After engagement and refinement, Gerbrandt plans to
            submit the research for peer review and publication in a Canadian medical journal, while advancing product
            development based on this demonstrated market demand.</p>

        <h3>About the Research</h3>
        <p>This market validation study was conducted by Abundant Science Inc., a Toronto-based, Canadian owned and
            operated independent company developing rapid testing solutions for Canadian healthcare markets. Full
